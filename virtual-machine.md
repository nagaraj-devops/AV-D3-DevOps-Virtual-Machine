## What is a Server?
- A server is basically a computer system or program that provides services, data, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network.

### Types of Servers

1. Web Server – Serves web pages (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
2. Database Server – Stores and manages data (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. File Server – Stores and shares files across a network.
4. Application Server – Hosts and runs applications.
5. Mail Server – Sends and receives emails (e.g., Postfix, Microsoft Exchange).
6. DNS Server – Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.

  
## Pysical vs Virtual

| Feature     | Physical Server              | Virtual Server                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Hardware    | Dedicated machine            | Shared (runs on a physical host)       |
| Scalability | Hard (requires new hardware) | Easy (create new VMs quickly)          |
| Cost        | High                         | Low                                    |
| Performance | Maximum (dedicated)          | Slightly lower (shared)                |
| Maintenance | Hardware + software          | Mostly software (less hardware hassle) |
